This is a Ruby on Rails application. 
Instructions for getting it to work on a *nix OS:
*   git clone the code to your box
*   Navigate to the dir where you put it (use a shell) 
*   execute `bundle install`
*   resolve any missing dependencies using `gem` and/or your package manager (Mac users use `brew`)
*   ensure the result of the `bundle install` command indicates success before continuing
*   execute `rails s` from within the code dir to create the rails server
*   use a web browser to access the application by navigating to the url indicated by the output of the `rails s` command (something like http://0.0.0.0:3000)
*   if you get a mysql error: 
1. start mysqld: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-linuxunix-excerpt/5.0/en/automatic-start.html
  *   ensure your root user exists and has the password defined in https://github.com/CuddlySquirrel/code/blob/master/config/database.yml
