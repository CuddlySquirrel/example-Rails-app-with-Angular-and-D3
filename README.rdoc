This is a Ruby on Rails application. 
Instructions for getting it to work on a *nix OS:
*   git clone the code to your box
*   Navigate to the dir where you put it (use a shell) 
*   execute `bundle install`
*   resolve any missing dependencies using `gem` and/or your package manager (Mac users use brew)
*   ensure the result of the `bundle install` command indicates success before continuing
*   execute `rails s` from within the code dir
Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject` and turn it into `**Reasonable**Project`.
