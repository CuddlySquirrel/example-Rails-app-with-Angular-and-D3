This is a Ruby on Rails application. 
Instructions for getting it to work on a *nix OS:
*   git clone the code to your box
*   Navigate to the dir where you put it (use a shell) 
*   execute ```bundle install```
*   resolve any missing dependencies using ```gem``` and/or your package manager (Mac users use brew)
*   ensure the result of the ```bundle install``` command indicates success before continuing
*   execute `rails s` from within the code dir
